Libraries Hacked website content
=====================================

This is the content repository for the Libraries Hacked website, currently hosted at [https://www.librarieshacked.org](https://www.librarieshacked.org). Updates made here will be automatically pushed to the website.

What it is
----------

All content on the { libraries: hacked } website is stored in markdown (.md) format. The website uses a Content Management System called Pico that does not rely on any external database, but uses files stored within a content directory.

This repository holds all the content. Directories are used to split the content into sections.
