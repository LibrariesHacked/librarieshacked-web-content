Most public libraries authorities in the UK submit *CIPFA returns* each year, a standard set of questions asking for annual loans data, visits, number of service points, expenditure, and more.  Sent to the *Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting* (CIPFA). These are compiled by CIPFA and released as annual library reports - available to subscribers, or for *£475* + VAT.

The individual returns collected by each authority are public data, though there are no examples of them being released as open data.  There are a number of examples of Freedom of Information requests for them on the [What do they know](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) FoI tracking site:

- FoI request: [Suffolk for CIPFA return data](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/library_cipfa_returns_2)
- FoI request: [Worcestershire for CIPFA return data](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/library_statistics_40)
- FoI request: [Derbyshire for CIPFA return data](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cipfa_2). In this case the request was initially refused by pointing the member of the public to the CIPFA holding of the data, an option clearly unreasonable given the cost.  That decision was overturned on review.

When the data is compiled it is then no longer public.  As CIPFA themselves pointed out on Twitter:


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/librarieshacked">@librarieshacked</a> We&#39;re a membership organisation not a government body, and our library data is funded by subscribers not the government.</p>&mdash; CIPFA (@CIPFA) <a href="https://twitter.com/CIPFA/status/683953497990115328">January 4, 2016</a></blockquote>

The aggregated multiple authority data is theirs and subject to copyright, and funded by their paying subscribers - though completely made up of public data that was collected through public funding.

This may have been an efficient method of compiling statistics across multiple authorities a number of years ago, but there are public data portals that can hold such data and make it freely available.  As well as making aggregating/combining and comparing the data for different authorities relatively easy - see [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) and [LG Inform Plus](http://opendata.esd.org.uk/).

The concept of an annual survey is also outdated.  There are many local government systems that set up automated data exports to a set schedule, which could be as often as is appropriate - every day, every month, or even every 5 minutes.  Not all the data collected for the CIPFA annual returns will support automated exports, but much of it could be done at far more valuable intervals.

## why make the data open?

If such data is made open, what is to stop people using it 'badly', or releasing analysis that is flawed?

While there are already many arguments against treating the public as untrustworthy data consumers, it's rarely a worry that ever becomes a real issue.  The bigger danger is with closed-data, only available to local authority leaders.  This can be used for poor policy-making, without the public having the opportunity of checking the data themselves.

An example of this is highlighted in a [Brent budget report](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/b8067/Budget%20report%20and%20appendices%20Monday%2015-Dec-2014%2019.00%20Cabinet.pdf?T=9) in December 2014.  This used the CIPFA data to suggest reducing the amount spent on stock in libraries:

<blockquote>
  <p>Benchmarking with other London boroughs shows that Brent spends a relatively [high] proportion of money on library books, audio visual material and online resources in comparison (comparing number of libraries and population).  Reducing the stockfund by £100,000 to £450,000 would see Brent with just above average stock spending in comparison to other London boroughs. For the stock spending per 1000 population’ indicator the reduction would see Brent move from 3rd to 2nd quartile in the CIPFA tables for London boroughs. </p>

</blockquote>

There is an argument that expenditure data is useful as one of many measures when analysing aspects of a service, and merging this with other data (such as usage) to identify links.  But in this case it is taken as a single indicator to inform policy, and the data isn't detailed enough to make any sensible decisions.  It is also a very selective strategy - in the instance of Brent, overall expenditure (per 1000 population) was significantly lower than average.  It was only in the single category for materials that the spend was above average.  Any reduction in spend would further reduce an already below average overall spend.

It also leads to the question of how many authorities use the CIPFA data in this way?  If authorities who are above average in certain expenditure areas consider this is a reason to get themselves in line with the average, those averages will consistently drop - making any downward trend a self-fulfilling one.  The CIPFA paid-for management information service then just serves as national justification for a race to the bottom in library investment.

Library usage and expenditure data is complex, and will always remain so.  Releasing aggregated annual statistics will only serve to inform poor policy decisions, which will then affect the data.  Then causing further poor decisions the next year.  It is often the case that some data is better than nothing.  With poor data that can't be scrutinised it can be far worse.

With detailed open data the public can oversee decisions made by their local authority, and analyse the data themselves to provide important local (and national) insights.  That is their right in the same way that they have a right to a library service.
