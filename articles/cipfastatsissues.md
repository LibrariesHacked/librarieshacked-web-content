Many public libraries authorities in the UK submit <abbr title="Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting">CIPFA</abbr> returns each year, answering a set of pre-defined performance measures.  These include counts of loans, visits, service points, expenditure, and more.  These are sent to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting, compiled, and released as annual library reports.  These are available to subscribers, or for £475 + VAT.

The data collected by each authority is rarely made publicly available, and there are no examples of these as open data.  There are a number of Freedom of Information requests for them on the [What do they know](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) site.

- <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> request: [Suffolk for CIPFA return data](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/library_cipfa_returns_2)
- <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> request: [Worcestershire for CIPFA return data](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/library_statistics_40)
- <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> request: [Derbyshire for CIPFA return data](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cipfa_2). In this case the request was initially refused by pointing the member of the public to the CIPFA holding of the data, an option clearly unreasonable given the cost.  That decision was overturned on review.

When the data is compiled it is no longer public.  As CIPFA pointed out on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/librarieshacked">@librarieshacked</a> We&#39;re a membership organisation not a government body, and our library data is funded by subscribers not the government.</p>&mdash; CIPFA (@CIPFA) <a href="https://twitter.com/CIPFA/status/683953497990115328">January 4, 2016</a></blockquote>

However the majority of the work to collect the data is paid for by the public, and undertaken by each authority.  As authorities subscribe to CIPFA in order to view the aggregated data, this is then paid for again by the public.  Then the DCMS pay CIPFA around [£42,000](http://www.cipfastats.net/news/newsstory.asp?content=17410) in order to release a set of PDFs comparing each authority.

This may have been an efficient method of compiling statistics a number of years ago, but there are public data portals that can hold such data and make it freely available.  As well as aggregating/combining and comparing the data for different authorities - see [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) and [LG Inform Plus](http://opendata.esd.org.uk/).

The concept of an annual survey is also outdated.  There are many local government systems that set up automated data exports to a schedule.  These could be as often as is appropriate - every day, every month, or even every 5 minutes.  Not all the data collected for the CIPFA annual returns will support automated exports, but much of it could be done at far more valuable intervals.

why make data open?
-------------------

If such data is made open, what is to stop people using it 'badly', or releasing analysis that is flawed?

There are already many arguments against treating the public are untrustworthy data consumers, but such concerns rarely become an issue.  A bigger danger is with closed-data, only available to local authority leaders.  This can be used for poor policy-making, without the public having the opportunity of checking the data themselves.

An example of this is highlighted in a [Brent budget report](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/b8067/Budget%20report%20and%20appendices%20Monday%2015-Dec-2014%2019.00%20Cabinet.pdf?T=9) in December 2014.  This used CIPFA data to suggest reducing spend on stock in libraries:

<blockquote><p>Benchmarking with other London boroughs shows that Brent spends a relatively [high] proportion of money on library books, audio visual material and online resources in comparison (comparing number of libraries and population).  Reducing the stockfund by £100,000 to £450,000 would see Brent with just above average stock spending in comparison to other London boroughs. For the stock spending per 1000 population’ indicator the reduction would see Brent move from 3rd to 2nd quartile in the CIPFA tables for London boroughs. </p><small>Brent Budget consultation document</small></blockquote>

There is an argument that expenditure data is useful as one of many measures when analysing aspects of a service, and merging this with other data (such as usage) to identify links.  But in this case it is taken as a single indicator to inform policy, and the data isn't detailed enough to make any sensible decisions.  It is also a very selective strategy.  In the instance of Brent, overall expenditure (per 1000 population) was significantly lower than average.  It was only in the category for materials that the spend was above average.  Any further reduction would reduce an already below-average spend.

It also leads to questioning how many authorities use CIPFA data in this way.  If authorities who are above average in certain areas consider this a reason to get themselves in line with the average, those averages will consistently drop.  This makes any downward trend a self-fulfilling one.  The CIPFA management information service then serves as National justification for a race to the bottom in library investment.

Library usage and expenditure data is complex, and will always remain so.  Releasing aggregated annual statistics will only serve to inform poor policy decisions, casuing a negative effect on performance.  It is often the case that some data is better than nothing - with poor data that can't be scrutinised it can be far worse.

With detailed open data the public can oversee decisions made by their local authority, and analyse the data themselves to provide important local (and national) insights.  That is their right in the same way that they have a right to a library service.
