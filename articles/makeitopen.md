There are lots of good reasons for public organisations providing open data, which is why it has seen such support from open data groups around the country, is [encouraged by the government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential), and organisations such as the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/).

For stretched library services, having an open data programme and publishing data can seem daunting.  But open data is as much about culture and attitudes than dedicating significant time or money.

Little will be achieved in one go.  We won't quickly move from a situation where there is almost no open data, to a position where all library servcies are publishing regular data in standard formats and well-defined schemas.  The hard task is achieving a policy of open by default:  this should be the position for any public library service.

There are regular examples of public libraries working on data, but NOT making it open.

On 28th December there was [an article in the East Anglian Daily Times](http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/lee_child_s_make_me_and_roald_dahl_s_the_bfg_are_most_popular_suffolk_library_books_in_2016_1_4830148) that listed the most popular Suffolk Libraries Books in 2016.  This gave information such as Lee Child's thriller *Make Me* being loaned out 1,800 times.  All great stuff, so where's the data?  Well, nowhere openly available.  On Twitter, Suffolk libraries kindly explained that it was put together from a combination of Spydus (the Civica Library Management System), and CollectionHQ (a stock management tool).  Given that the work was done to collect the data, why not just make it open?

The Society of Chief Librarians recently [announced the results of a poll on the UK's favourite book](http://goscl.com/pride-and-prejudice-named-uks-favourite-book/).  Although fairly small scale, the announcement described many good things:  

- "The list represents a diverse range of readers across all libraries in the UK."
- "We had very new books named such as All the Light We Cannot See. Our diverse collection of books is a valued resource."

The only actual data provided by the announcement was a top 10 list of titles, with no polling figures.  For an organisation that represents the leaders of public libraries across the country, that seems a shame.  The Libraries Taskforce [Ambition document](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/libraries-deliver-ambition-for-public-libraries-in-england-2016-to-2021/libraries-deliver-ambition-for-public-libraries-in-england-2016-to-2021) includes data as a key tast, including the challenge to "adopt, collect and share data".  The SCL [Welcomes the objectives outlined in Ambition and is ready to help deliver them](http://goscl.com/scl-response-to-libraries-deliver-ambition-for-public-libraries-in-england-2016-2021-2/) - it would be a good start to lead by example with open data.

These are minor recent examples, and not necessarily the fault of either of those two organisations; they are both laudable attempts at data analysis.  They just illustrate a general attitude of not providing supporting open data.

There are more significant examples.  Public Lending Right collect statistics from a significant number of library services, and pay authors for the lending of their works.  They release annual press releases about this data but it is in the form of [PDF top lists](https://www.plr.uk.com/mediaCentre/mostBorrowedAuthors/mostBorrowedAuthors.htm).  These are not that useful for anything other than simply reading.  It must be pointed out that PLR provide a system for librarians and researchers to access and explore this data.  Yet the data isn't overly complex - there seems little reason why this couldn't simply be a number of open data releases.  Again, this is a cultural shift to providing open data by default rather than unnecessarily locked down systems.

There are many flaws in the [CIPFA annual library statistics](http://www.cipfa.org/services/statistics/comparative-profiles/public-libraries), but they are still collected by a majority of library services.  Having gone to the significant difficulty of putting that data together, the library services then submit it to a private membership organisation that sell it back to them, sell it [to the DCMS](http://www.cipfastats.net/news/newsstory.asp?content=17410), and anyone else wishing to pay [Â£427.50 for a PDF](http://www.cipfa.org/policy-and-guidance/publications/c/cipfa-library-profile-2016).  If the libraries simply released this data openly there would be no need for this, but it is a practice that still continues.  At the very least the data could be submitted to CIPFA **AND** made open.

## tips for open data

So, what could bring about a change in this culture?

- **Think open by default**.  If you are conducting a poll, doing some data analysis from the library catalogue, or anything else, could it be open data?  Unless it includes personal data then it most likely can.
- **Don't believe that people aren't interested**.  Is there a real valid reason for not releasing your data, or is it one of the [10 excuses for open data](http://myeinsteinjob.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/top-10-excuses-to-not-open-data.html)? (terrorists are unlikely to use it).
- **Don't believe it takes a lot of effort**.  The local authority will likely already be able to use [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/), or [the LGA open data platform](http://opendata.esd.org.uk/).  Many local authorities also already have their own open data platforms, or there will be a local open data community group with one.  Failing any of those options, simply uploading files to the local authority or library catalogue website is fine.
- **Request data**.  If you want data from your library service or any public body, then request it.  This could be a Freedom of Information request but it's worth just asking nicely first, and encouraging the service to release it to everyone.
