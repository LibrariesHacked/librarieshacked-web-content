## OCLC global library stats

A Libraries Hacked tutorial post from 2014, [YQL and global library stats](https://www.librarieshacked.org/tutorials/yqlstats) used the OCLC global library statistics web pages as an example of extracting web data using Yahoo Query Language (YQL).

That was to demo YQL as a tool rather than draw attention to the stats themselves.  The [OCLC global library stats](https://www.oclc.org/global-library-statistics.en.html) were an attempt by the OCLC to collect together some basic stats for public/academic/school/special libraries for each country, such as number of libraries, volumes, members, and librarians.  The data was manually collected and the relevant sources listed.  

The OCLC appreciate counting libraries across countries is difficult as service points are not consistently defined.  They settle on the following compromise:

<blockquote>For the sake of uniformity, the total number of libraries represents administrative units and not service points, since not all sources report service points consistently. Some of the country entries did not specify which unit they were reporting, in which case it was assumed that it was administrative units.</blockquote>

The administrative units figure is a strange one to choose as it doesn't really represent provision of library services.  In the UK the administrative unit is generally the authority, which can vary hugely in size and number of branches.  Administrative unit is more representative of community, geography and spread of population.  The assumption that a figure supplied will be administrative units and not number of libraries seems dubious as well.

Looking through the data it's possible to spot some oddities:

- Estonia seems to be an example where the number of administrative units seems very similar to the complete number of libraries. The source is [from the IFLA](http://db.ifla-world-report.org/home/map#/2/2/G8TWX1EQKSOGSCH): 'Estimated number of public libraries in the country: 560: 487 main libraries, 73 service points'.  The OCLC give the 487 figure. 
- The UK is the opposite to the above.  It is said to have 184 public libraries - this is probably the library authorities but the actual number of libraries would be between 3 and 4 thousand.
- The Netherlands is listed as having 177 public libraries.  
- Latvia is listed as having .  This appears to be the total number of branches - a http://www.kis.gov.lv/download/Economic%20value%20and%20impact%20of%20public%20libraries%20in%20Latvia.pdf


An excellent site, Practical Statistics, looks at the accuracy of the data, paying particular attention to the data for Norway:

[Practical Statistics - OCLC Initiative](https://sites.google.com/site/practicalstatistics/2-events/ifla-singapore/oclc-initiative)

The OCLC data is still interesting to browse - and in particular for the various sources, but not good for serious comparative analysis.  Clearly put by Practical Statistics:

<blockquote>The results are not encouraging. The library statistics that OCLC offered for Norway could not be used for serious work. The quality was far too uneven. OCLC faced the same problem that Unesco faced. Countries with weak library systems have hardly any statistics at all. There may be some numbers floating around, but they do not reflect the situation on the ground. Countries with stronger systems have better statistics, but they do not publish them in a form that is convenient for outsiders.</blockquote>

## world literacy rankings

A recent report on 'literature behaviour characteristics' ranked Finland as most literate nation, with the UK ranked 17th.

[Guardian - Finland ranked World's most literate nation](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/11/finland-ranked-worlds-most-literate-nation)

The report is detailed at [World's Most Literate Nations](http://www.ccsu.edu/wmln/).  It doesn't just use educational test results, but also uses cultural measures: 

- educational investment 
- newspaper circulation 
- access to computers
- number of public/academic/school libraries, and number of volumes in pulic libraries

Those library measures seem familiar and they do [turn out to be](http://www.ccsu.edu/wmln/dataSources.html) the OCLC global library statistics.



Take the following examples

According to official statistics, Estonia has 55 university research and special libraries, 420 school libraries and seven government-funded research libraries.

For number of public libraries it seems to be one of those occasions where the number has been 'assumed to be administrative units'.
