## OCLC global library stats

A Libraries Hacked tutorial post from 2014, [YQL and global library stats](https://www.librarieshacked.org/tutorials/yqlstats), used the OCLC global library statistics web pages as an example of extracting web data using Yahoo Query Language (YQL).

That was to demo YQL rather than draw attention to the stats themselves.  The [OCLC global library stats](https://www.oclc.org/global-library-statistics.en.html) were an attempt by the OCLC to collect together some global stats for public/academic/school/special libraries such as number of libraries, volumes, members, and librarians.  The data was manually collected and the relevant sources listed for each entry.  

The OCLC appreciate counting libraries across countries is difficult.  They settle on the following method:

<blockquote><p>For the sake of uniformity, the total number of libraries represents administrative units and not service points, since not all sources report service points consistently. Some of the country entries did not specify which unit they were reporting, in which case it was assumed that it was administrative units.</p><small>OCLC - Global Library Statistics.</small></blockquote>

The administrative units figure is a strange one to choose as it often doesn't really represent what many people think of as number of libraries.  It's used to get away from differing defintions of service points but each country will have considerably different systems of administration.  In the UK the administrative unit is generally the local authority, which can significantly vary in size and number of libraries.  Administrative unit is more representative of community, geography and spread of population.  It also seems odd that the assumption that a figure given would be administrative units.

Looking through the data it's possible to spot some oddities:

- Although library numbers are dropping, the UK is said to have 184 public libraries.  Even if another 1000 libraries were to close, that number of authorities could just stay the same - it gives little indication of library provision in the UK.
- Estonia is an example where the number of administrative units seems very similar to the complete number of libraries. The source is [from the IFLA](http://db.ifla-world-report.org/home/map#/2/2/G8TWX1EQKSOGSCH): *'Estimated number of public libraries in the country: 560: 487 main libraries, 73 service points'.*  The OCLC list the 487 figure.
- The Netherlands is listed as having 177 public libraries but it seems they have been steadily 
- Latvia is listed as having .  This appears to be the total number of branches - a http://www.kis.gov.lv/download/Economic%20value%20and%20impact%20of%20public%20libraries%20in%20Latvia.pdf
- The data sources go back fairly considerably.  Data for Morocco was from a report in 1980.  Browsing online now reveals that rather than just 


An excellent site, Practical Statistics, looks at the accuracy of the data, paying particular attention to the data for Norway:

[Practical Statistics - OCLC Initiative](https://sites.google.com/site/practicalstatistics/2-events/ifla-singapore/oclc-initiative)

<blockquote><p>The results are not encouraging. The library statistics that OCLC offered for Norway could not be used for serious work. The quality was far too uneven. OCLC faced the same problem that Unesco faced. Countries with weak library systems have hardly any statistics at all. There may be some numbers floating around, but they do not reflect the situation on the ground. Countries with stronger systems have better statistics, but they do not publish them in a form that is convenient for outsiders.</p><small>Practical Statistics - OCLC Initiative</small></blockquote>

## world literacy rankings

A recent report on 'literature behaviour characteristics' ranked Finland as most literate nation, with the UK ranked 17th, of 60.

[Guardian - Finland ranked World's most literate nation](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/11/finland-ranked-worlds-most-literate-nation)

The report is detailed at [World's Most Literate Nations](http://www.ccsu.edu/wmln/).  It doesn't just use educational test results, but also uses cultural measures: 

- educational investment 
- newspaper circulation 
- access to computers
- number of public/academic/school libraries, and number of volumes in public libraries

Those global library statistics seem familiar, and they do [turn out to be](http://www.ccsu.edu/wmln/dataSources.html) the ones from the OCLC.

The method used to rank the countries for libraries is to take the unreliable OCLC data and create a measure rank for that country relative to the population size.

Looking through the rankings you therefore see some clear patterns:

- The list becomes largely reflective of population size.  China, with a population of over a billion, are at the bottom of the ranking,
- Where the number of libraries used is not administrative units those countries do better.  For example, are ranked top for libraries with 487 libraries (and a relatively small population).
- Where there are obvious mistakes in the data, these get highlighted in the results. 
-- Morocco are ranked second from bottom due to the mistake in their library counts.

OCLC data source: http://db.ifla-world-report.org/home/map#/2/2/G8TWX1EQKSOGSCH

Estimated number of public libraries in the country: 560: 487 main libraries, 73 service points

According to official statistics, Estonia has 55 university research and special libraries, 420 school libraries and seven government-funded research libraries.

For number of public libraries it seems to be one of those occasions where the number has been 'assumed to be administrative units'.
