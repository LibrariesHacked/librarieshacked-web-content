Libraries Hacked is a website designed to promote open-source technology hacks and projects in libraries.  That means these things:

## data sources
The site will highlight where to find library data sources around the web, focussing on *web services* and *APIs*, as these are most useful when creating new solutions.

## open source code
Though not exclusively limited to featuring open-source solutions, the site will act as a platform for hosting code repositories (through github), and any code created through the site will be made available to all to download, or directly work on to enhance.

Any examples of interesting open-source library projects around the web will also be listed.

## hack events in libraries
*Hacks* produce technological solutions created within communities, to provide innovative uses of data. 

Libraries are places for data and information, and making that open to the community.  A natural setting for hack projects is therefore a library, which is why this site focusses on library hack events.

## articles and collaboration
Articles from a variety of sources will be put on the site to provide guidance for those interested in the technology featured.  Some examples of these will be:

- library technology suppliers focussing on the technological aspects of their solutions.
- descriptions of tools used for data analysis. 
- experiences of library hack events.

Any contributors will be given a link to work on an article which can directly be published to the site, and they will always have access to this to make modifications as necessary.

## events
With a National libraries festival, Exeter Fab lab, Pi and Mash, and more, there is already an exciting lineup for 2014.

Website launch dates tend to be the point a website is ready to begin, rather than a date when it is finished.  In this case it is definitely the former - more content will be available soon.
