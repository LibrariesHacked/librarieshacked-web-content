Explaining open data can be difficult. Not the meaning of open data, a short sentence can serve:

> data made available to the public without restriction

But 'why' is tricky. Why invest time and money in it? What's in it for *us*? What's in it for *me*?

People have no hesitation in using open data. Library services would hardly refuse book reviews to put on catalogue sites, population data to analysing library usage, bibliographic data to aid in cataloging, deprivation data for analysing membership reach. When these are free (open) it's great, and we take advantage of that. Yet the idea that library data could serve needs outside of the service isn't often considered. And even when it is, it still doesn't answer **why** it should be done. Services are quite naturally selfish: happy to use whatever they can get hold of, but not share.

Yet libraries are not historically selfish about providing data and information. Few library managers would ask why they should be providing books and information to the public for free. We're aware of the value of ensuring the public have access to data and information; this is why we have public libraries.

That's possibly a decent enough reason for an information professional to explore open data, but it wouldn't cut it for a manager. Library services are fixed in what they do: we recognise book lending, and computer use, as core library functions. For a manager there will be little interest in adding to what libraries do just on the grounds that they *should* do it, either ethically or professionally.

Speaking to people who are enthusiastic about open data, many have a moment at which it 'clicked'. That could be attending an event (like the [#ODCamp](http://odcamp.org.uk/) unconference), it could be seeing an example of open data being put to public use, or just frustration at an existing lack of data in certain areas. It seems like open data has not 'clicked' in public libraries, though there's a growing awareness of issues arising from UK libraries being left behind in data.

- The Libraries Taskforce held data workshops at their Ambition events in 2016. Frustrations made clear were staff not having the time to work on data, and not always having the skills to analyse data. All this while knowing that there is more in that data that could be used to inform the service. That's a problem that wouldn't be solved by open data, but when people ask 'why?' to open data, a suitable response is to ask if data is currently used internally to it's potential.

- The IFLA have just released their [Library Map of the World](https://librarymap.ifla.org/) showing basic measures of libraries (issues, staff, internet access, etc), in different library sectors, across many countries. There's no data for the UK. That doesn't mean there's no current data that couldn't be put up there in future, but certainly from a public library perspective it looks grim.

But, the frustrations of not having any data STILL isn't a good enough argument for open data. And neither is jealousy at other countries being better, they're also thriving in many other ways as well. We can *hope* that the public would make more of data than libraries have time to, but it's not guaranteed. Maybe no-one will care. Maybe the data will only be used in the same way as it is within library services: in times of crisis and consultation. And that likely means criticism of the authority. No-one wants another stick to be beaten with.

So, how to persuade library managers that open data could be something to spend time on?

It's not about doing good
-------------------------

The idea that open data is something that libraries should be doing, for professional integrity and social reasons, is great. But a waste of time for getting buy-in.

So, make open data about service improvement. It's about seeing libraries benefit in the way other services have by embracing open. It's about events and community engagement. Use value stories, and examples of where open data is used in extraordinary ways. Point to large open data communities, and ask managers to imagine what could happen if those people suddenly found the library relevant in engaging with what they do.

Link it to existing processes
-----------------------------

CIPFA (Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountants) library data is still popular among managers, the data library services collect annually. The investment in CIPFA is extraordinary. Not just in money paid, but the time spent in contributing to a private dataset for someone else to resell. It's an absurd situation that could be comical, if it weren't for the amount of money and destruction of library services due to it. But it's not all bad. What do CIPFA do well, and why do managers love it?

- It's standardised. There's often a happy, haphazard feel to open data. "What columns of data should we export? Don't worry about it! Shove it all out and we'll have a look." That's fine, but what do CIPFA provide? A reassuring Excel spreadsheet for everyone to fill out with exact fields to complete, and definitions of each one. It may be stupidly manual, and involve ridiculous questions, and require converting your categories of things to theirs (an immediate loss of data), but it's 'easy' time, because everything needing to be done has been laid out.

- It's reassuringly secret and expensive. The public do not have easy access to full CIPFA data because they can't afford it. The data's largely used to see where services are 'overspending' and adjust accordingly. However, it's too vague and imprecise to be used in this way. If made open it could be used to inform a debate, between libraries and the public as to how money is spent. But it's never possible for services to exactly compare and adjust something like number of professional posts between library authorities, despite CIPFA promoting this use.

The closed nature of CIPFA data isn't compatible with open data priciples. But we can do more to ensure standards in open data. As more services begin looking at open data we should share practice between our different systems, and start co-ordinating how to do certain exports. If we could get to a stage where the data could be compared between authorities (but was far better than CIPFA), then it wouldn't be outrageous to suggest to a manager the equivalent time spent on CIPFA should be spent in this way. Then promote new ways that data could be used in engagement with the public.

Lead in innovation, don't follow
--------------------------------

Library services are not seen within local government as being innovative. We all know that's due to lack of investment, but it's the way it is. [Councils are investing in bins](http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/your-council/news-and-publications/latest-news/2462-crushing-blow-for-litter-in-the-dales) that are more innovative than any core library service technology.

Open data is seen as innovation. It may not be, it could more easily be seen as a natural extension of library functions, but either way, libraries need to lead on it. Not wait to be the only ones left in local government not doing it. Leading on open data means:

- Being in control of workload. If services wait to do it then it's far more likely to be imposed upon them. That's harder to manage.
- Access to funding. Councils are investing in open data. Open data project managers, open data programmes, online portals. None of that money is coming to libraries because people don't believe that public libraries have anything to do with providing information to the public.
- Career success. Managers are careerists. Not in a negative way, it's just pretty likely they haven't randomly fallen into management roles. There's nothing like leading an innovative service to also help with a career.

Existing Policy
---------------

In local government there are requirements for certain datasets to be made open, as a minimum. These are laid out as part of the Local Government Transparency Code 2015. The code goes further than specific datasets, and also states:

> the Government believes that in principle all data held and managed by local authorities should be made available to local people unless there are specific sensitivities (eg. protecting vulnerable people or commercial and operational considerations) to doing so. It encourages local authorities to see data as a valuable resource not only to themselves, but also their partners and local people.

This is not ambiguous, it's what services need to be doing. But policies shouldn't be a stick to beat people with, they're informative and formed through evidence. It's important for all members of a service to know about these policies. They can then take the policy as a starting point and formulate their own particular reasons for following it.

Do it anyway, and say you're doing it
--------------------------------------

Managers aren't always good at making decisions. They manage and empower their staff to make decisions in their own areas of expertise. So if you want to do it, and feel comfortable with the data you work on, get on with it.

This doesn't have to start with things that could be controversial. What are your day-to-day reports? Top titles being lent? Push it out as open data. Summer Reading Challenge completion data? Just update it on your website and tell anyone interested (internal or external) to find it there.

Asking a manager to decide whether they want to do open data is just asking them a tricky question. Like asking if they want a biscuit or a cake. It's too difficult to answer, never ask that. Tell them you've baked a cake, shared it out, and they're welcome to have a slice.
