Explaining open data can be difficult. Not the meaning of open data, a short sentence can serve: 

> data made available to the public without restriction

But 'why' is tricky. Why invest time and money in it? What's in it for *us*? What's in it for *me*? 

People have no hesitation in using open data when it suits them. Library services would hardly refuse data on book reviews to put on catalogue sites, population data to analysing library usage, bibliographic data to aid in cataloging, deprivation data for analysing membership reach. These things are essential and sometimes free, sometimes not. When they're free (open) it's great, and we take advantage of that. Yet the idea that library data could serve needs outside of the service isn't often considered. And even when it is, it still doesn't answer **why** it should be done. Services are quite naturally selfish: happy to use whatever they can get hold of, but not share.

Yet libraries have a unique viewpoint in this. They're not historically selfish about providing data and information, it's part of their reason for being. Hopefully few library managers would ask why they should be providing books and information to the public for free. We're aware of the value of ensuring the public have access to data and information; this is why we have public libraries.

That's possibly a decent enough reason for an information professional to explore open data possibilities, but it wouldn't cut it for a manager. Library services are fixed in what they do: we recognise book lending, and computer use, as core library functions. For a manager there will be little interest in adding to what libraries do just on the grounds that they *should* do it, either ethically or professionally.

Speaking to people who are enthusiastic about open data, many have a moment at which it 'clicked'. That could be attending an event (like the [#ODCamp]() unconference), it could be seeing an example of open data being put to public use, or just frustration at an existing lack of data in certain areas. Many local government have 

It seems like Open Data has not 'clicked' in public libraries though there's a growing awareness of issues that arising from UK libraries being left behind in data (open and otherwise).

- The Libraries Taskforce held data workshops at their Ambition events in 2016. Frustrations that became clear were staff not having the time to work on data, and not always having the skills to analyse data. All this while knowing full well that there is much more in that data that could be used to inform the service. That's a problem that wouldn't be solved by open data, but when people ask 'why?' they should release open data, a suitable response is to ask if they believe data is currently utilised to it's potential. For library services it particularly isn't.

- The International


But, the frustrations of not using data to its full potential STILL isn't a good enough argument for open data. And neither is jealousy at other countries being better, they are thriving in many other ways as well. We can hope that the public may make more of data than libraries have time to, but it's not guaranteed. Maybe no-one will care. Maybe the data will only be used in the same way as it is within library services: in times of crisis and consultation. And that likely means criticism of the authority. No-one wants another stick to be beaten with.

So, how to persuade library managers that open data could be something to spend time on?

Tying it to existing processes
------------------------------

CIPFA data is still popular among managers, the data library services collect and send to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountants. The investment in CIPFA is extraordinary. Not just the money paid, to consume their data, but the actual time taken to collect it and do all the work for it. It is a considerable amount of time spent in contributing to a private dataset for someone else to resell.

It's such an absurd situation that it would be comical if it weren't for the amount of money going into it. Plus the destruction of the service due to the data not being open but badly used by services. But it's not all bad. What do CIPFA do well, and why do managers love it?

But what can we learn from CIPFA? Somehow it has persuaded managers to invest large sums of money.

- It is reassuringly secret.  The public do not have easy access to the full CIPFA data. The data is used largely to cut services - it is data for managers to see where they are overspending and adjust accordingly.  However, it is too vague and imprecise to ever be used in this way. It can be used to inform a debate, between library services and the public as to how money is spent, but it's never going to be possible to exactly compare something like number of professional posts per 1000 members of the population between distinct library authorities.

- It is standardised. There is often a happy, lacksadaisacal feel to open data. What columns of data should we export? Don't worry about it! Shove it out there and we'll have a look. Thta's fine but what do CIPFA provide? A reasuring spreadsheet to fill out with the exact fields you need to complete, and definitions of each one. Do you have your own categories of items.  Great, but you need to convert them all to our categorisations. You need to dedicate a lot of time to it but it is easy time because everything that needs to be done has been laid out.

The secretive nature of CIPFA will not resolve with open data. But we can do more to ensure standards in open data. 




It's service improvement, not doing good
----------------------------------------

The idea that open data is something that libraries should be doing, for professional and social reasons, is great. But a waste of time for getting buy-in.

So, open data is about service improvement. It's about seeing libraries benefit 



Lead, don't follow
------------------

Library serviuces   What does leading on open data really mean, to a library manager:

- Being in control of workload.
- Access to funding
- Career success


There are examples
------------------

Open Data case studies are important.  They show where data has been used in the past.  



Personally, for myself, it was probably a hack day .  I already did 'hacking' in my own time with data sources.  And already had frustration about not being able to find data that I wanted.  But somehow this hadn't all quite come together in my mind.  The relatively simple concept of having structured data, released by organisations

Most people will usen open data regularly without necessarily knowing it's open data.  That's good, the power of open is not to bang on about itself, it's to create benefit to society.

Existing Policy
---------------

You can throw managers polciie

The Local Government Transparency Code .


POlicy shouldn't be a stick to beat departments with.  Policies are there for a reason.

It's important for each service in a local authority to appreciate policies are in pace.  Data protection principles, ethical guidelines, and plenty of others that they are expected to adhere to as part of a wider authority, and prt of local government.

ere data has been used in the past.
