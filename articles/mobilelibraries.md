Everyone should expect to live within a reasonable distance of their library service.  While that may seem like a luxury, mobile library services are a good way for councils to provide a service that spans across the whole authority.

Looking at an example, Bath and North East Somerset have a fixed library service that is patchy in terms of actual area coverage.  The map below shows how the 8 libraries span across very little of the actual authority.  Visualising a radius of 1 mile for each library, and 1 mile for each mobile library stop (when selecting **Toggle mobile libraries**), the library service appears far more healthy, with few areas left without a library service.

There is more to mobile library provision than simply number of stops.  There are hours, frequency, timetables, etc.  But it still seems to be an effective way to provide a service that can reach all areas, especially in rural communities.
