**Everyone should expect to live within a reasonable distance of their library service.**  While that may seem like a luxury, mobile library services are still a way for councils to provide a service that spans across the whole authority.

Looking at an example, Bath and North East Somerset have a fixed library service that is patchy in terms of actual area coverage - the map below showing how the 8 libraries span across very little of the actual authority.

Visualising a radius of 1 mile for each library, and 1 mile for each library stop, when adding the mobile libraries (click *toggle mobile libraries*), the library service appears far more healthy, with few areas left without a local library.

There is more to mobile libraries than simply number of stops (hours, number of services etc.), but it still seems to be the most obvious way to provide a service that reaches all areas.
