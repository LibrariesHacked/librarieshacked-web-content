Open data, library technnology and hack events in libraries.

Open Data is data made publicly available with a licence allowing reuse without restrictive terms.  Tim Berners Lee's 5 star open data plan also provides a guidance to open data quality.  This includes just making stuff available, to using open formats, to linking data to other datasets to provide additional context.

The UK is currently ranked top for open data in the world.  This is largely due to the work of local open data groups and enthusiasts pushing for more open data nationally and locally.  The ODCamp unconference  

Why make data open?  There are various studies that point to wider economical benefit, such as a Deloitte report that claim, and also the Open Data Institute (ODI) that .  But at a more individual service level benefits can be imagines by asking very simple questions.  Is data currently being used to it's full potential?  

Say open data and many services will think 'Freedom of Information' and think of lost hours fulfilling requests for who said what in which email.  Being asked to release open data then cam then just seems like more encouraging.  Of course FoI is an esssential right for citizens that must be protected, but it's a mistake to see open data as being about transparency and accountability.  For stretched services, that would seem like a self-indulgent luxury.  Open data (like open source, open access, etc) is about letting go of control.  That means giving access to the library management system to the public, opening up the catalogue data,   

It also means letting go of the idea that library management can define library performance.  Public libraries currently have national (non-open) performance data data based on historic opinions on what needs to be measured.  But where such measures attempt to **collect** data, an open data strategy **releases** data, with few pre-conditions other than respecting personal data.  This better matches a library's relationship with the public.  It is the public that define the performance of their library.  The data released then engages citizens and encourages them to form their own questions of it.   Rather than being told answers to questions that they may not agree with in the first place, it allows individuals to add their own insight.  

Libraary data can appear in many places.  Ian Anstice releases regular news posts on the popular Public Libraries News site.  Looking at these posts it's easy to see them as a dataset.  There is a regular structure:  local news by authority, changes, international news.  It becomes a database of sorts.  A libraries hacked project queries public libraries news for new posts each night and extracts the local news stories.  This was initially done just as a tutorial for web scraping and geocoding data to display on a map, but Ian then asked whether that map could be put back on the public libraries news website in the sidebar.  If the data is there it can be done, and was. 

It's is made possible purely by the dedication of one librarian and an attribution statement: creative commons.  The code is also available under the MIT open sourec licence, adn the data is available for re-use under the terms Ian uses.


It is a shame not just that libraries are not publishing open data, but that libraries are not seen as leaders in this field.  Open data portals are not lead by information professionals, and as such have become messy, unstructured dumping grounds for datasets.  This is exactly the area where information professional expertise would be so useful.

Newcastle libraries took this approach in their recent open data releases of library data, saying ''.  When running a hack day to invite the community to come and use the data, there were no specific questions they asked individuals to set about answering.  Just provide the data, and let people do what they will with it.

Open data releases can only go so far in creatihg new applications and systems.  For 


APIs .  
This is not about mimicking commercial models like Twitter and GoodReads, it's about wondering why their systems are more accessible than public libraries'.

Hacks are 

Hacks make sense in public libraries for many reasons.  

Look around the Internet and you can find hacks people engaging with library websites and library data to fill holes in existing library provision.  But these currently rely on either taking badly formatted data (like a PDF), or building systems using web automation scripts.  There are scripts to automatically renew library loans, library membership apps that combine all your library accounts (university/public) into a single portal, adn much more.  But that creativity could be happening directly in the library.  As well as that libraries have the community focus to get more people involved.  Traditional hack events have tended to focus on developers.


It is worth anticipating how to deal with losing control over the ways users will interact with library services.  Currently, the majority of interactions are defined by the service itself, whether that is renewing an item, or checking one out.  With APIs made open, much of that control is lost.  Existing library membership apps don't offer automatic renewal options, but this is likely to be the first thing unofficial apps will offer.  Then if an app can be set to automatically renew an item imminently about to become overdue, will that change the way in which . Is it worth bothering with renewals at all?

It will also change .  Web stats on how a web catalogue is visited and accesses will still be useful, but if library transactions could be made from any app/website then these won't be of much use 

Concepts like a single digital library presence seem outdated when looking at existing technology models, and how services are provided.  Even if there were a single libray authority, it is unlikely that a single presence would provide services in the way that each user wanted them.  Certainly it's important to provide an online library presence, but to then open that open for others to do the same.  More important would be a single set of web services
