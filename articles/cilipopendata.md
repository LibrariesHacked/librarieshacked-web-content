## Open Data

Open Data is data made public with a non-restrictive licence, allowing anyone to reuse it for any purpose.  The 5-star open data plan provides guidance on open data quality.  This includes just making stuff available (maybe a PDF - 1 star), to open formats linked to other datasets (linked open data - 5 stars!)[1].

The UK is currently top ranked for open data by the Open Data Barometer[2], and 2nd by the Open Knowledge Foundation[3].  This is a partly due to open data enthusiasts pushing for more national and local data, and how organisations have responded to that demand. 

Why make data open?  Studies point to wider economic benefit, such as an Open Data Institute (ODI) and Nesta report suggesting a 5 to 10-fold return on investment over 3 years[4].  But for an organisation, benefits can be imagined by asking very simple questions.  Are we using data to it's full potential? Could it be merged with data from elsewhere?  Are those sources open and available?  Do we have the time and skills to do all these things, or should we let other people have a go?

A barrier to open data has been suspicion and fear of data requests, associating it with transparency obligations such as freedom of information.  But public and private organisations are realising that data-sharing benefits everyone.  An external demand and interest in data can be of direct benefit. 

What to make open?  Bath and North East Somerset Council have an open data policy[5] which states they will provide any data requested of them.  The few exemptions are for data that is personal/sensitive, third-party owned/commercial, or that could pose a security risk.  It's a policy that has led the community to dictate what they want, requesting live car park occupancy, cycling/traffic counts, maps of city assets and green spaces, and much more.  Far from being purely an exercise in transparency, this has been a process to use local data to create technical solutions, and inform policy (a 'smart city').

It's easy to enthuse about all this, but where's the link to libraries?  Part of the problem is that there rarely is one.  The 'smart city' agenda promoted by government[6] has largely ignored libraries.  But cities have been 'smart' since they've had public libraries.  It's odd that a movement to engage and inform citizens about their immediate environment, and enable community solutions, would exclude libraries - where such activity has always been promoted and enabled.

Articles often try to envisage a 'library of the future', imagining the changing role of libraries.  But the lack of library involvement in open data processes (which can often receive significant funding) is a departure from a historic role, not a future opportunity.  Addressing it is not a suggestion of any change in focus or existing skills.  Open data needs libraries, and professional library skills.  Local and national open data portals, such as data.gov.uk[7] are often a chaotic mess.  Few metadata standards, conflicting structures, poor categorisations, and no conventions.  They're not beyond hope, they just require those essential skills listed in CILIPs 'types of job' pages[8].

## Library data

There is also a lack of open data about public libraries, such as catalogues, usage data, opening hours, or static and mobile library locations.

The benefits to libraries in having comprehensive open data are clear.  Measuring performance is not handled well by existing processes.  Current national (non-open) performance data is based on historic opinions of what needs to be measured, and incomplete data.  But where performance measures attempt to collect specific data, an open data strategy simply releases data.  It is the public that define the performance of their library.  The data released engages citizens and encourages them to form their own questions and conclusions of it.  Rather than being told answers to questions they may not even agree with, it allows individuals to produce their own insight.  

With a lack of official open data, library-related data can still appear in many places.  Ian Anstice releases regular news posts on Public Libraries News (PLN)[9].  Looking at these it's easy to see them as a dataset with regular structure:  local news by authority, ideas, changes, international news.  A libraries hacked project queries PLN for new posts each night and extracts the individual stories.  The data is then embedded into the sidebar of the PLN site as an interactive map to show the spread of news across the UK.

Sue Lawson and Julia Chandler worked to produce a Google sheet that listed libraries, library authorities, and their twitter accounts.  Another project, a twitter gallery[11], provides a view of those accounts with information such as when the account was created, last tweeted, and number of tweets/followers.  It's been interesting to watch, @manclibraries started tweeting way back in 2007 while some authorities are still creating accounts.  @hull_libraries have a massive 60,000 tweets, well over double their nearest challengers, and compared to an average of .

## Hacks

Look around the Internet and you can find plenty of examples of engagement with library data and systems.  There are scripts to automatically renew library loans, library membership apps that allow for managing multiple library accounts (university/public), and much more.  These are small 'hacks' - hacking together systems and data with enthusiasm and a spirit of exploration, and not being too bothered if it doesn't work out.  They don't need to be serious policy-forming analysis.  Simply engaging with data, creating 'mashups' with other services is often enough to see where more sophisticated solutions could be created, and where better data is required.

The popularity of engaging in this kind of hacking has led to hack events (hackathons), often run by tech companies or groups of developers.  These have often focussed on a stereotypical view of developers and encouraged fairly anti-social working patterns (feed them pizza and beer through the night and they'll make software).  But this isn't always the case, the organisation Data Kind run 'Data Dive'[12] events, getting together developers, designers and data scientists (and good food!) to use those skills for community and charity causes.

To run community hack events you really just need community spaces that are suitable for working, have WiFi, have experts on hand to give guidance on data, and try to ensure a balanced and wide-ranging community contribution.  In other words, they should be run in libraries, which have space, infrastructure, expertise, and are safe and trusted community spaces with widespread appeal.

The current situation is promising and exciting.  Newcastle Libraries have started an open data process, and started running hack events encouraging use of this data[13].  Libraries hacked aims to promote open data and hacks in libraries, as these activities don't feel like vague libraries of the future, but as making good use of all the skills and resources that libraries already have.
