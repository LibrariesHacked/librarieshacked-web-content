## Open Data

Open Data is data made public with a non-restrictive licence.  The 5-star open data plan provides guidance for open data quality.  This includes just making stuff available (maybe a PDF - 1 star), to open formats linked to other datasets (linked open data - 5 stars!)[1].

The UK is currently top ranked for open data by the Open Data Barometer[2], and 2nd by the Open Knowledge Foundation[3].  This is a partly due to open data enthusiasts pushing for more national and local data, and how organisations have responded to that demand. 

Why make data open?  Studies point to wider economic benefit, such as an Open Data Institute (ODI) and Nesta report suggesting a 5 to 10-fold return on investment over 3 years[4].  But for an organisation, benefits can be imagined by asking very simple questions.  Are we using data to it's full potential? Could it be merged with data from elsewhere?  Are those sources open and available?  Do we have the time to do all these things or should we let other people have a go?

Previous barriers to open data have been a natural suspicion and fear of data requests, associating that process with transparency obligations.  But both public and private organisations are realising data-sharing benefits everyone.  And external demand for their data could be of direct benefit to them.

What to make open?  Bath and North East Somerset Council have an open data policy[5] which states they will open up any data requested of them.  The few exemptions are for personal/sensitive data, third-party owned/commercial, or a security risk.  It's a policy that has led the community to dictate what they want, requesting live car park occupancy, cycling/traffic counts, mapping of green spaces, and much more.  Far from being an exercise in transparency, this has been a process to use local data to create technical solutions, and inform policy (a 'smart city').

It's easy to enthuse about, but where's the link to libraries?  Part of the problem is there rarely is one.  The 'smart city' agenda promoted by government[6] has largely ignored libraries, but cities have been 'smart' since they've had public libraries.  It is odd that a movement to inform citizens about their immediate environment, and enable community solutions would exclude libraries, where such activity has always been promoted.

Articles often try to envisage a 'library of the future', imagining changing the role of libraries.  But the lack of library involvement in open data processes (which can often receive significant funding) is an abberation.  Addressing this is not a suggestion of any change in focus or existing skills.  Open data needs libraries, and existing professional library skills.  Local and national open data portals, such as data.gov.uk[7] are often a chaotic mess.  Few metadata standards, conflicting structures, poor categorisations, no conventions.  They just require some of the skills listed in CILIPs 'types of job' pages[8].

## Library data

There is also a lack of open data about public libraries, such as library catalogues, usage data, opening hours, or static and mobile library locations.

The benefits to libraries in having comprehensive open data are clear.  Measuring performance is not well covered by existing processes.  Current national (non-open) performance data is based on historic opinions on what needs to be measured, alongside incomplete responses.  But where measures attempt to collect specific data, an open data strategy simply releases data.  It is the public that define the performance of their library.  The data released engages citizens and encourages them to form their own questions of it.  Rather than being told answers to questions they may not agree with in the first place, it allows individuals to produce their own insight.  

With a lack of official open data, library-related data can still appear in many places.  Ian Anstice releases regular news posts on Public Libraries News (PLN)[9].  Looking at these it's easy to see them as a dataset, with regular structure:  local news by authority, changes, international news.  A libraries hacked project queries PLN for new posts each night and extracts the individual stories.  The data is then embedded into the sidebar of the PLN site as an interactive map to show the spread of news across the UK.

Sue Lawson and Julia Chandler worked to produce a Google sheet that listed libraries, library authorities, and their twitter accounts.  A libraries hacked twitter gallery[11] provides a view of those accounts with information such as when the account was created, last tweeted, and number of tweets/followers.  @manclibraries started tweeting way back in 2007.  @hull_libraries have a massive 60,000 tweets, well over double their nearest challengers.

## Hacks

Look around the Internet and you can find examples where people engage with library data.  There are scripts to automatically renew library loans, library membership apps that combine all your library accounts (university/public) into a single portal, and much more.  These are small 'hacks' - hacking together systems and data with enthusiasm and a spirit of exploration, and not being too bothered if it doesn't work out.  They don't need to be serious policy-forming analysis.  Simply engaging with data, creating 'mashups' with other services is often enough to see where more sophisticated solutions could be created, and where better data is required.

The popularity of engaging in this kind of hacking has led to hack events (hackathons), often run by tech companies or groups of developers.  Traditional these have focussed on a stereotypical view of developers and encouraged fairly anti-social working patterns (feed them pizza and beer through the night and they'll make software).  But this isn't always the case, the organisation Data Kind run 'DataDive'[12] events, getting together developers, designers and data scientists to use those skills for community and charity causes.

To run community hack events you really just need community spaces that are suitable for working, have WiFi, have experts on hand to give guidance on data, and try to ensure a balanced and wide-ranging community contribution.  In other words, they should be run in libraries, which have space, infrastructure, expertise, and are safe and trusted community spaces that have widespread appeal.

The current situation is promising.  Newcastle Libraries have started an open data process, and started running hack events encouraging use of this data[13].  Libraries hacked aims to promote open data and hacks in libraries, as these activities don't feel like libraries of the future but as making use of all the skills and resources that libraries already have.
