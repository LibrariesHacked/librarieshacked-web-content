Every year Public Lending Right release data on the books and authors most popular in UK libraries.  This data is made up from contributing authorities - there is a system for accessing PLR data ([LEWIS](https://www.plr.uk.com/lewis/lewis.aspx)), but only accessible with a qualifying library account.

The data released in PDF form is available to be used and made widely available (giving acknowledgement of the original source, which is [PLR](https://www.plr.uk.com/mediaCentre/mostBorrowedTitles/mostBorrowedTitles.htm)).  Here is the data for the regional *top 100 titles* in searchable and sortable tables.
