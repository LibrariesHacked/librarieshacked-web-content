Every year Public Lending Right release data on the most popular books and authors in UK libraries.  This data is made up from select contributing authorities.  There is a system for accessing PLR data ([LEWIS](https://www.plr.uk.com/lewis/lewis.aspx)), but only accessible with a qualifying library account.

The data released in PDF form is available to be used and made widely available (giving acknowledgement of the original source, which is [PLR](https://www.plr.uk.com/mediaCentre/mostBorrowedTitles/mostBorrowedTitles.htm)).  Here is the 2014 data for the regional **top 100 titles** in searchable and sortable tables.
