## introduction
bookmark your library is a website providing information, compiled by librarians - it also feature various interactive web application tools.
## library finder
navigating to the find a library section, bookmark integrates a library finder into the site.  enter any uk address and it uses the google places api to resolve the address to a geo-location, and finds the nearest public libraries within a 5 mile radius; it then displays these on a map.  clicking on a library will display the name, address, and other contact details if available.
## find a book
while not directly integrated into the site, bookmark uses the oclc book search widget to search for particular books in nearby libraries.
## ask a librarian
chat with a librarian live - 24/7! powered by enquire, a collaboration between uk and us libraries, enter your location and the site will find a local librarian to answer your questions.  not all authorities are signed up to this, but for those that are it looks like an impressive chat feature.
## top 10 borrowed items
bookmark also shows the top ten borrowed items in uk libraries.  this data is supplied by and copyright to Nielsen BookScan, taken from the LibScan panel for the latest period.
## local information
the scl (society of chief librarians) who are partners in creating the site are working on a feature to add local library data to various categories of information.  this means a user will be able to enter a location and be given a link to local data on each particular subject (such as *health*), compiled by the library authority in that area.
