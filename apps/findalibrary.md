find a library is a web app powered by the culture grid library data, and created by the collections trust.
## how it works
the site is optimised for mobiles.  on the start screen you simply enter a location or click *use my location* and it will display a map with the nearest libraries plotted on it.
clicking on a library displays further address and contact information.
## editing the data
participating authorities should have a username and password so that they can modify the data for each library to ensure it is kept up to date.
