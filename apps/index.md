interactive maps, library finders, library job searches, membership apps, collections - there are many web based and mobile apps available with relation to libraries.

have you made a library app?  would you like it to be featured here?  it would be great if you could provide more info about it, even write an article explaining how it works, and especially good if you could share the code (perhaps using [GitHub](http://www.github.com)).  contact @librarieshacked on twitter or email: info at librarieshacked.org
