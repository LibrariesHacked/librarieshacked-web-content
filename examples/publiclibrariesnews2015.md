*/
An example of using D3 JavaScript visualisation library to display the libraries news stories from 2015 (per month).  Data taken by extracting the *local news by authority* sections of [Public Libraries News](http://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/) news posts (*CC Attribution 3.0*).

Click on each location/authority to see the news for that year.

Visualisation is based upon an original available by Asif Rahman, visualising [journals published over time](http://neuralengr.com/asifr/journals/) - discovered on the [D3 gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery).  Always somewhere worth a look for inspiration.
