## cookies and analytics
this website uses the piwik analytics tracking code.  this collects data about users such as the time of the visit, their browser, the device, and some data derived from their IP address.  piwik offers administrators the option to anonymise this IP address - by taking out the last two sections it becomes much more general such as showing that a user is from the UK rather than showing they're from a particular town/city.  this option has been used on this site.

the site used to use google analytics, by far the most popular analytics tracker used by websites.  however, that data is stored on google servers and can be shared for marketing purposes, especially with other google advertising services.  so any analyics data on this site is held on the same server as the site.

if you are concerned about google analytics, you can opt out by going to [this google page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

no other part of the site uses any kinds of cookies.
