Library catchment areas

What is a library catchment area?  It's used to describe the geographical area representing the home locations of the users of a library.

Interpretations vary.  Is it the geographical area within which people are reasonably able to access the library e.g. a certain mile radius or travel time?  Is it based on the home locations of the existing registered members of the library, or just those who have been 'borrowers' within the last year?  Or, is it the area from which ALL visitors to the library may come (which for some tourist destinations could be very large)?

For library services, defining catchment may depend on what they want to achieve.

- to assess library locations (static and mobile) to see if these are spread appropriately.
- to understand which demographics (e.g. based on income or age) are less likely to be library users
- to understand which communities aren't currently library users.
- to tailor services of libraries depending on existing membership.

Geographic analysis of public libraries is often done immediately before a consultation exercise.  But geographical intelligence, which in turn gives intelligence about people and services, should not be limited to informing service cuts.  It is important to understand the residents that each library serves (and *could* serve but doesn't), and the different requirements that may go along with that.  

Introducing better geographical intelligence to all library based reporting (e.g. simple monthly issue/visit stats) could stop these being 'one-off' exercises.  The results of such catchment profiles are often used for many years, rather than being an ever-changing profile.

What have library services done in the past to define catchment?  This post will look at 3 quite different examples.

- **Gloucestershire**, library provision 2012.
- **Bedford**, library profiles 2014.
- **Sutton**, consultation 2014.

Before that, here is some jargon.

**LSOAs** - Lower Super Output areas.  These are small geographical areas of an authority (e.g like a Ward or Parish), but are created from Census data in order to collect statistical profiling of that area.  They all have roughly the same number of people (around 1500 people) and households, so are good for comparisons, unlike Ward or Parish (or even postcode) which are more random.
**OAs** - Output areas.  These are the base unit census areas - smaller in size than LSOAs but they used as the 'building blocks' that make up LSOAs (e.g. a particular LSOA may consist of 5 OAs).  They tend to consist of around 300 people.
**Indices of deprivation** - These are statistics on deprivation that are released by the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> for each LSOA.  There are around 35,000 LSOAs in England, each one is ranked agaist the rest by deprivation measures (e.g. income, or education).  For example, a community east of Jaywick near Clacton-on-Sea is defined as the most deprived overall in all of England.
**Mosaic** - This is a commercial (from Experian, the credit rating people) demographic profiling tool.  This profiles households into 15 main socio-economic groups and, within this, 69 types.  For example, the groups are things like 'Happy Families' (which represent families from Middle England), a type may be 'Upwardly mobile South Asian families living in inter war suburbs'.  The data will also give marketing indications such as whether the household is likely to take advantage of free credit, which is why the tool is used frequently by financial marketing departments.

## Gloucestershire 2012.

In 2012, Gloucestershire developed a new library strategy.  This involved creating library catchment areas.  But Gloucestershire is huge area.  instead of just creating a catchment area for each library they created 6 main catchment area districts - each one having a set of libraries that would then be assigned their own catchment area.  The 6 districts referred to are Gloucester, Cheltenham, Stroud, Tewkesbury, Forest of Dean, and the Cotswolds, which largely parallel district council areas.

Sample source: [Gloucestershire County Council Library Service: Context and User Needs Assessment](http://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx%3Fid%3D50181%26p%3D0&ved=0ahUKEwjq0fbWh6vRAhWqD8AKHeMrBWkQFggaMAA&usg=AFQjCNFJ66tYUzOsudg1yU5vFk9dGjkMjQ&sig2=XYSdmzrDSgTqsNgnL-kENw)

So what methodology is used to create the library catchment areas?

> To aid consideration of library service provision within distinct areas of the county much of the detailed information and analysis is organised into subsections or ‘clusters’ that broadly parallel the six districts and includes the libraries that sit within that district. The library catchments reflect natural communities and local issues such as public transport, main road links and shopping facilities rather than being strictly distance or district based.

> In 2003 the Library Service wanted to understand the characteristics of the communities served by each library. In consultation with library managers, catchments were drawn up using COAs as a basic unit. The catchments reflect natural communities and local issues such as public transport, main road links and shopping facilities rather than being strictly district based. Using these enabled the Research Team to report Census 2001 information for each library.

This method of defining catchment appears to be a largely manual exercise, using the expertise of library managers and other intelligence to decide which areas are assigned to each library.  This could be quite a time consuming task - Gloucestershire consists of hundreds of Output Areas, but it is likely that the majority of it may be fairly obvious (e.g. the immediate area surrounding a library).  It is interesting to see such an exercise not being done in isolation from the expertise of those involved in running the libraries, where often it can be outsourced to <abbr title="Geographic Information Systems">GIS</abbr> departments or research intelligence teams.  It is the managers and staff who will know the most about their own users.

Gloucestershire have:

- Created catchment areas that have no overlap between different libraries (each area uniquely identified with a library).
- Used expert knowledge to assign these areas to libraries.
- Not directly based catchment areas on current membership or usage (aside perhaps as another aspect of expert knowledge).
- Ensured that each area of the authority is assigned to a library.

## Bedford Library Profiles 2014.

In 2014 the Bedford Borough Council Community Intelligence team profiled Bedford's libraries.  This included defining an '*all users main catchment area*', and an '*IT only catchment area*' for each library.  Those areas were then profiled using the ONS indices of deprivation and Mosaic profiling.

Sample Source: [Beford Central Library Reach and Catchment Area] (https://www.bedford.gov.uk/council_and_democracy/statistics_and_census/idoc.ashx%3Fdocid%3D9f2e59fd-f282-4c80-a64e-031a7c5d17ee%26version%3D-1&ved=0ahUKEwiRncnIw6nRAhULLcAKHVj1BLoQFggdMAE&usg=AFQjCNEp48h2fskANQsyGnlLTxJnTdVc9A&sig2=Qt5hRqclwz7EcfowqxLxtw)

Although these provide detailed profiling of each library's catchment areas, they don't include a definition of how the area itself was defined.  On querying this, Bedford have said that the individual who did the work has left and unfortunately that knowledge has left with them.  These things happen, it is failry clear though that the two catchment areas are based on different usage profiles, and therefore taken from usage and member address information.  That membership has been analysed to define IT users, and all users, and construct two different geographical areas.

This is the opposite to the method used by Gloucestershire, who take the geography of the whole authority to split up the areas, regardless of current membership.  The profiles are worth reading for the disparity between the different types of catchment areas for a single library.  

Bedford have:

- Used member usage data as a primary indicator for catchment but done this on different usage types to take account of IT use.
- Not recorded their methodology for future use.

## Sutton, consultation 2014.

Sources: [Libraries and culture downloads](https://www.sutton.gov.uk/downloads/200168/libraries_and_culture)

As part of a consultation, Sutton created PDF profiles of each of their libraries, defining the catchment area of each library as:  *"The library catchment area includes all Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) where 5% or more of the population borrow from the library."*

This type of catchment area is purely based on 'borrower' members - a borrower being someone who has had an issue or renewal from the library within a certain timeframe (e.g. within a year).

There are disadvantages to this idea of a catchment area.  It takes no account of library users who use the computers, WiFi, or other materials without being borrowers.  It also does not guarantee that all areas of an authority will fall into the catchment of a library.  For needs analysis this can be questionable - regardless of membership or usage, the local authority provides a service for all residents.  It is reasonable to assume all residents should fall into the catchment of at least 1 library.

The methodology does allow for catchment areas that overlap between libraries.  In this way, Sutton Central library catchment area actually includes 91 of the 121 LSOAs in Sutton.  This seems more realistic than an approach which neatly divides an authority into distinct areas, with each area served by a single library.  

A problem occurs though when a library does not have any LSOAs where 5% of the population are borrowers of that library.  This was the case for Beddington library.

"The catchment area for Beddington Library is therefore taken to be the two LSOAs which contain the highest numbers of active Library members."

That seems an arbitrary definition of a catchment area.  It pre-defines the number of people that will be included as part of the catchment area (a figure that is used later on in the analysis - that the population of the catchment area is 1% of the population of Sutton).  

Beddington library was actually situated very close to the intersection of 3 LSOAs.  Because the definition only allowed for 2 LSOAs to be included, this means a major third community was not defined as being part of the catchment area.  Looking at this on a map it leads to a situation where a location across the street from the library is not considered part of its catchment area.  This makes the profiling of the library catchment area less meaningful.

Sutton also do some data analysis around driving distances.  A '10 minute drive area' is plotted around Beddington library to suggest alternative libraries that could be reached by car, of which there are 3.

There is no logical reason to use the location of Beddington library for this.  The suggestion is that existing users of Beddington library could drive to 3 other libraries within 10 minutes.  It would be more appropriate to plot a 10 minute drive area from the centre of the library catchment area to accurately represent the distance that may be needed to travel by the population.  Because the library is actually at the edge of the catchment area, the majority of people would actually have to travel further than is described.

The '10 minute driving zone' is a 2 mile radius around the library.  The assumption being that 2 miles = 10 minutes by car.

In September 2015 a proposal to Sutton residents was put on closing Beddington library.  As part of the justification it included:

> Beddington library’s catchment area does not score highly on measures such as the indices of deprivation and the needs analysis. In particular, the area is well served by public transport and 84% of people in the area have access to a car/van.

Beddington library was closed in 2016.  In 2016 Sutton Borough Council were featured as a case study in the Libraries Taskforce Ambition document: *"The consultation on changes to Sutton libraries was backed by research mapping demographic trends and needs analysis across the borough. This was so staff had a clear view of the communities the libraries serve."*

Sutton have:

- Defined catchment based on borrrower type members only
- Allowed for overlapping catchment areas, allowing for how the central library actually draws in people from across the authority.
- Used a definition of catchment area that did not work for all libraries - making inconsistent defintions within the same study.
- Not included all of the authority in their profile analysis - excluding some communities.

## Conclusions

There is clearly no right or wrong way to define library catchments.  But from looking at different examples it's possible to make some suggestions.

- If defining catchment areas based upon existing usage and membership it's important to use more than just borrower data.  Bedford showed that including IT Only users created very different catchment areas.
- A definition of a catchment area should be consistent.  The Sutton definition of a catchment area didn't work for Beddington library, which was then assigned a catchment under a different definition.  
- If assessing the needs of the authority, and how well a library service fulfills these, it is important that ALL areas of the authority are included in some way.
