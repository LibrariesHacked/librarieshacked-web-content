## what is HTTPS and why is it important?

You are in public and need to talk in confidence with an individual.  You need to:

- be sure they're the right person.
- agree a code to make sure others listening can't understand.

Perhaps they would show some ID.  You may shake hands, and in a secret handshake, agree a code to talk in.

Information Technology often uses real-world terminology to describe tech processes.  The above situation is played out whenever you visit a website that uses encrypted communication, preceded with the HTTPS (**https://**) protocol.

- **SSL certificate:** *SSL Certificates are small data files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organizationâ€™s details.*[^1]
- **Handshake:** *During this handshake, the client and server agree on various parameters used to establish the connection's security: The client sends the server the client's SSL version number, cipher settings, session-specific data, and other information that the server needs to communicate with the client using SSL.*[^2]
- **Man in the middle:** *In cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle attack is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.*[^3]

Using encryption has been regarded as a minimum for login and payment transactions, but is more frequently being used for all online communications. 

It's important to assess the requirement for encryption not just in the context of risk to the data for that service.  Many recent hacks against individuals have been a result of credentials leaked from insecure accounts, then used to gain access to more secure services.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had his Twitter and Pinterest accounts hacked as a result of leaked LinkedIn credentials[^4].  Twitter CEO Jack Dorney and Google CEO Sundar Pichai have had similar experiences.  If a service requires login, the likelihood is those credentials will be securing all sorts of other data.  Protecting them is essential.

## UK libraries

How well do UK library authorities ensure patron security?  A web catalogue generally includes login, which should only be offered over a good standard of encryption.  Anything else would compromise credibility to manage and share data.
However, encryption is not just a yes/no.  Getting it **right** means addressing at least the following potential situations:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Only HTTP | Sites that offer no encryption. |
| HTTP and HTTPS (Mixed Content) | Sites where there is a mix of HTTPS/HTTP content on a page (for example the page may include an image with an HTTP URL).  The URL in the web browser will appear to be HTTP but the browser is less likely to show the site as secure (e.g. padlock, and green bar). |
| HTTPS (Allows HTTP) | Sites that offer login over HTTPS but it isn't enforced.  For example, a link could be shared that mistakenly used an HTTP address.  Sites should enforce HTTPS if it's available. |
| HTTPS (vulnerable) | Sites that offer HTTPS but there could be numerous issues with the implementation on the web server or the certificate.  Browsers offer some indication of this quality (such as a 'full green bar') but more advanced checks are available. |
| HTTPS (good) | Sites that have a high quality SSL implementation and certificate |

Current UK public web catalogues are shown below, with an indicator as to whether HTTPS is available, and any issues if so.  This does not give full details of security vulnerabilities, and it's advised for services do their own checking.  If any further guidance is needed in doing this, feel free to email **info** at **librarieshacked.org**.

The majority of these can be tested simply by visiting the site (for further methodology see **what to do** suggestions below).

## updating post

This post will be updated regularly to reflect changes.

- Original tests completed: **17th July 2016**.
- Update: **1st September 2016**.  Replaced older catalogue listings for Welsh library authorities moving over to combined LMS.
- Update: **6th September 2016**. Warrington [moved to Koha LMS](https://livewirewarrington.co.uk/news/library/1025-livewire-introduce-new-library-management-system) in August 2016.

## what to do?

Are you part of a local authority?  Firstly try to ensure your IT department include the online catalogue in any annual **penetration tests**.  Not only will the tests be carried out by external, accredited professionals, but negative results will be dealt with urgently.

Some basic testing of web security doesn't need experienced testers (known as ethical hackers).  The following steps can be undertaken:

1. Is the site using an HTTPS web address?  This should be visible in your web browser URL bar.  Check login and membership pages in particular.  All browsers should indicate encryption next to the address, such as a green bar or padlock.  See **How to Know if a Website is Secure**[^5] for more info.  If not using HTTPS, contact the supplier and IT to get this implemented.
2. If already using HTTPS, can the login be accessed by HTTP instead? Try changing the address to HTTP and see if it redirects back to HTTPS.
3. As site owner, check the site against an online SSL checker such as SSL Labs[^6].  This will give detailed and complex results, but also a simple grade of quality.  You should ideally be getting an A grade, anything lower report to supplier and IT to investigate.
