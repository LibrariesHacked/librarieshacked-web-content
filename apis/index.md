## what is an API?

an *application programming interface* (API) specifies how software components interact with each other (thanks *[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)*).  this interaction is often in the form of *web services*.  integrating with an API can be useful as it makes it possible to get up to date data that is maintained in one place.

## licensing, open data, and API keys

some of the services listed require registration to access (represented by a locked padlock).  this may be because they wish to limit the number of requests, or that there are particular licensing terms.  please pay attention to the licensing statements for each particular service.  licensing will not be detailed here as it may be subject to change for each service.
