an application programming interface (**API**) specifies how software components interact with each other.  this interaction is often in the form of **web services**.  integrating with an API makes it possible to retrieve data that is up-to-date and maintained in one place.

some of the services listed here require registration to access.  this may be because they wish to limit the number of requests, or that there are particular licensing terms.  please pay attention to the licensing for each particular service.  licensing will not be detailed here as it may be subject to change.
