many people will have heard of the raspberry pi, even if they don't know what it is.  it received a lot of media attention when it launched and continues to be enthusiastically used.
# what is it?
the raspberry pi is essentially a very small computer.  only a little larger than a credit card, the pi doesn't have any external casing, meaning you get to see the components.  for connectivity it has two usb ports (so you can connect external storage, and mouse/keyboard), an hdmi port for connecting to a monitor or tv, a power socket (using a standard micro usb charger - like a phone)
## why could it be used in libraries or hacks?
the pi is a computer that is designed to enable children (and adults) to learn about how technology works, and to learn to program.  
## options for use in libraries and hacks

- *check-out operating systems*. because the pi uses an sd card for its storage, including operating system, this means it is very easy to switch between operating systems.  for example, if a library had bookable raspberry PIs, they could be on display but without an sd card.  the user simply goes to the checkout desk, asks for a raspberry pi and is given their choice of operating system on an sd card.  when they have finished their time, they return this, and it can be refreshed back to it's previous state.  there is then no need for security within the system.
- *a makeshift web server*.
