the google chromecast was released in the UK in 2014 and allows users to stream content to their television using wireless, from their chrome browser or other apps on their desktop, tablet or phone. 
## how is it setup?
the chromecast plugs directly into an hdmi port in a tv.  it does need a relatively new (probably less than 5 years or so) tv to have one of these.
it can be powered via usb cable.  if the tv has a usb input then normally this can be used to power the chromecast, making it unnecessary to use any other power cables or sockets.  otherwise a standard mobile style charger and usb cable can be used.
## software development kit (SDK)
the chromecast also offers the means for individuals and groups to get together and extend functionality to applications for use with chromecast.  for example, any android app could be made so that it had the option to send content to an available chromecast receiver.  notable examples of this are the bbc iplayer app, and netflix app.
