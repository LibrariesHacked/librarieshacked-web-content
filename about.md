Title: about the site
Description: promoting open data and hacks
---

## why **hacked**?
**hacks** and **hacking** are the process of creating tech solutions, often very quickly, and dispensing with normal project processes.

it is also associated with **hack days** or **hackathon** events (or even **codefests**).  these are normally opportunities to publish data openly, in order for developers to be let loose on it during the event, ending up with prototypes of systems, or data mashups.  this site aims to compile some of those data sources, list tools that are commonly used, and keep up to date with future events.

while hack days are associated with data analysis and coding, there are also **makerspaces** and **fab labs**.  these are increasingly being run by libraries, and associated with using emerging tools such as 3D printers and mini-computers (like the Raspberry Pi) to encourage community learning and creativity.

## what does { libraries: hacked } do?
the site has two primary aims: 

- to promote libraries as being spaces appropriate for hacks, as well as pushing for more library-based open data;
- to provide a directory of library data, hardware, and software tools.

## target audience?
the target audience for the site are those who are interested in library technology, open data, and participating in hacks.  a certain amount of technical jargon will be used (such as in tutorial posts).  tutorial posts will always feature a comment facility to query/challenge any of the content.
