Title: about the site
Description: promoting open data and hacks
---

## why **hacked**?
**hacks** and **hacking** are the process of creating tech solutions, often very quickly, dispensing with normal project processes.

**hacking** is also associated with **hack days** or **hackathon** events (or even **codefests**).  prior to these events data is published openly in order for developers to be let loose on it during the event, ending up with prototypes of systems or data mashups.  this site aims to compile some of those data sources, list tools that are commonly used, and keep up to date with future events.

while hack days are associated with data analysis and coding, there are also **makerspaces** and **fab labs**.  these are increasingly being run by libraries, and associated with using emerging tools such as 3D printers and mini-computers (like the Raspberry Pi) to encourage community learning and creativity.

## what does the site do?
the site has two primary aims: 

- to promote libraries as being spaces appropriate for hacks as well as pushing for more library-based open data;
- to provide a directory of library data, hardware, and software tools that could be used in hacks.

### library hacks
a public library (or any other library) is a perfect place to hold hack events, having the location, wifi, tools, information professional expertise, community, and available data sources. 

### library data
there is all sorts of data that could be used in hacks, but that data is extensive - making a website trying to cover it all would be impossible. this site compiles data directly relevant to libraries and library collections, and attempts to push for that data to be released under an open licence.

## technology and platform agnostic
while promoting, and providing a platform for open source/open data, the site is open to information from all with regards to library technology and data.  regardless of technology or commercial background it will feature library solution providers where they can be useful to the general community.

## target audience?
the target audience for the site are those who are interested in library technology and participating in hacks.  a certain amount of technical jargon will be used (such as in tutorial posts).  tutorial posts will always feature a comment facility to query/challenge any of the content.
