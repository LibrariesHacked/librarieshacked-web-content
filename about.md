hacked
------

hacks and hacking are the process of creating tech solutions, often very quickly, and not using typical project processes.

the term is also associated with hack days or hackathons.  these are opportunities to publish data openly, in order for developers to work with this data during an event, ending up with very quick prototypes of systems, or data mashups.  this site aims to compile some of those data sources, list tools that are commonly used, and keep up to date with future events.

while hack days are associated with data analysis and coding, there are also makerspaces and fab labs.  these are increasingly being run by libraries, and associated with using emerging tools such as 3D printers and mini-computers (like the Raspberry Pi) to encourage community learning and creativity.

{ libraries: hacked }
---------------------

the site has two primary aims.

- to promote libraries as being spaces appropriate for hacks, as well as pushing for more library open data;
- to provide a directory of library data, hardware, and software tools.

target audience
---------------

the target audience for the site are those who are interested in library technology, open data, and participating in hacks.  a certain amount of technical jargon will be used (such as in tutorial posts).  tutorial posts will always feature a comment facility to query/challenge any of the content.
