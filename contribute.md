- **suppliers**:  if you are a supplier of library technology it would be great to get a technical insight into how that technology works.
- **hackers**: have you attended an event, created a web/mobile app, or analysed any library data?
- **beginners**: how are you getting into library data?  how accessible is it?

## the process

all content for this site is held in the [librarieshacked-web-content](https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/librarieshacked-web-content) GitHub repository.  for more details on using GitHub, a good place to start is the [Library Carpentry GitHub module]().

## policies

your content will be published into the site, but it remains your content to edit and tweak as you wish as long as it appears to be relevant to the [site](/about) and is not illegal.
