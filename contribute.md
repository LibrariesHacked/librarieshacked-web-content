libraries hacked is open to contributions from any interested parties with relation to technology in libraries and hacks.  if you are a supplier of library technology it would be great to get a technical insight into how that technology works.  if you are interested in library hacks and technology and want to share ideas or insight then this is a place you are welcome to do so.

## what could you contribute?

as well as being open to all ideas, it would be great to have:

- articles on library software by suppliers;
- accounts from people who have participated in hacks;
- people looking at setting up hacks, fab labs, maker spaces in libraries;
- analysis of library data and statistics;
- reviews of software and hardware for use in hacks.

## the process

- fill in the submission form,
- you will then be emailed a link to start work on the content,
- at the press of a button this can be sent for authorisation, and will then be published.

## you control the article

your content will be published into the site by an administrator, but it remains your content to edit and tweak as you wish.  aside from the common elements displayed on the pages of this site, you will have complete control over what appears.
